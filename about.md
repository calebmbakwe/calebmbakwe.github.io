I'm an Entreprenueral Engineer. Ok, if you don't understand that, don't bother. I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a Backend Preference.
I have built a plethora of solutions, built a number of startups and solved many problems across several sectors
Other than writing code, I like to give back to the community positively by mentoring developers, offering training sessions and giving motivational talks.
If you are a budding startup and need some advice on how not to fail, I can put the skills I have put in my startups (both failed and existent) to advice you on yours.

### What I've done...

- _Health_: I built two versions of a Health Information System which is in use by hospitals
- _Education_: I was part of a team that developed an eLearning suite of solutions which pioneered the first online MBA in Nigeria and was also used by 3 universities across over 10 courses. 
- _Religion_: I implemented and currently maintain a solution used by over 40 churches across the world with a user base of about 4000 christians.
- _Recruitment_: I worked with a partner to build a community of developers withthe aim of getting them placements with companies
- _Dating_: I built a dating platform that sadly was not as good as Tinder
- _investment_: I built a solution to predict the value of companies based on their past financial records
